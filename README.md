Instructions:
1. Download the two source code python files ("prologlike_new.py" and "run_prolog_via_python.py")
2. Make sure that you will save these two files in the same file in yourcomputer
   e.g. the filepath of the two files should be C:\Users\YourProfile\Desktop\examplefile\prologlike_new.py and   C:\Users\YourProfile\Desktop\examplefile\run_prolog_via_python.py
3."prologlike_new.py" works like a library and "run_prolog_via_python.py" is the module where pur library is loaded and through it we can run prolog. So in order to test a prolog code file(a ".pl" file) in this implemantiation :
  a)open the "run_prolog_via_python.py"
  b)notice the line in which is written this :selected_file=None
  c)change the world none with the filepath of the prolog file that you want to run
    e.g. if the path of your Prolog file is for example C:\Users\YourProfile\Dekstop\test.pl,then write in the place of "None" this r"C:\Users\YourProfile\Dekstop\test.pl"
 
Now you are ready to test my WAM Implemention in Python!!!
